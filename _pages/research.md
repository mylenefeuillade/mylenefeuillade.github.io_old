"Household, gender and agglomeration economies"
Abstract: In this paper, I study the impact of location choices on earnings and employment by gender and marital status, using administrative data from France. Using an event-study setting, I find that women suffer significantly more from moving both in terms of income and employment. I then study how this varies with the size of the destination city, and show that relocating to Paris attenuates the negative impact of a move experienced by women. Next, I investigate further the gender gap in agglomeration gains by estimating the urban wage premium by gender. Using a standard two steps approach, I find that women benefit significantly more from city size than men, but that this is not driven specifically by married women.
