I am a PhD student in Economics at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html). I work on topics of urban and labor economics, with a focus on gender gaps and household decisions. I work under the supervision of [Pierre-Philippe Combes](https://sites.google.com/view/pierrephilippecombes/).

I am currently spending a year in PSE, as a PhD Fellow in the [Labor Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/pse-partnership-programme/chairs/labor-chair/).
